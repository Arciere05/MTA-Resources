# Dice Game vs NPCs

This script introduces a simple, fast-paced dice game where players can challenge NPCs by simply getting close and pressing "E" to roll the dice.

**How It Works:**

- Initiating the Game: Players approach an NPC and press "E" to instantly roll the dice.
- Dice Roll: Both the player and NPC roll a pair of dice. The outcome is determined based on the highest total dice roll.
- Quick and Simple Gameplay: No complicated mechanicsâ€”just get close to an NPC, roll, and see who wins.

Note: You need to have DGS resource installed if you wish to run this resource.
